### Overview
This is a python based machine learning project which can predict price of any automobile explicitly for Cars by just entering the features of that vehicle . Here is also an api developed for single or bulk file upload for prediction analysis which has been made with the motto of user friendly interpretations .

## Installation 
 As this is whole python based project so python38 is the base for this model and then for libraries installation i have attached a file named requirements.txt from where you can download all the required libraries in a single go by just typing the following command in the command prompt after installing python
 
 ```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
 
 ## Dataset details
 
 The dataset used in our model is from the UCI repository which is a automobiles (Car) dataset which has been recorded in the year 1985 , that means that the data set is very outdated as for now.Many features used in ther dataset are not even in use now-a-days .

## UI overview

Here as you can see i have uploaded the option for both single and bulk upload , means you can upload a file containing many records and the prdict on its basis
If the user  choooses for the Single inputs then it will get redirected to :
#### for SINGLE inputs

Here as the user input all features values he will get the output for the car price , for more information you can test it even for file upload as well


## Model_Retraining

Here we have also give option for model retraining which can be a very nice way of training model on new instances and then getting predictions on new data  

this option can be used if after years we have some new records for the automobiles then we can use them and then can predict our car price


## Deployement Link

Here we have deployed these application on heroku as well as on AWS ec2 instance but we have stopped aws ec2 instance so providing only heroku app link as below
